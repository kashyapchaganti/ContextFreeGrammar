    "\n",
    "- NP -> PRP: This rule indicates that a noun phrase (NP) can be a pronoun (PRP).\n",

    "- VP -> VerbT NP: This rule states that a verb phrase (VP) consists of a transitive verb (VerbT) followed by a noun phrase (NP).\n",

    "- NP -> Proper: This rule shows that a noun phrase (NP) can be a proper noun (Proper).\n",

    "- VP -> VBZ NP: This rule indicates that a verb phrase (VP) can be a present tense verb (VBZ) followed by a noun phrase (NP).\n",

    "Overall, these grammar rules capture the structure of the first sentence, involving noun phrases, verb phrases, pronouns, and proper nouns.\n",

    "- S1 -> NP VP CC VP Eos: This rule represents the structure of a sentence (S1) consisting of a noun phrase (NP), a verb phrase (VP), a coordinating conjunction (CC), another verb phrase (VP), and an end-of-sentence marker (Eos).\n",
    "\n",
    "- NP -> Proper: This rule indicates that a noun phrase (NP) can be a proper noun (Proper).\n",
    "\n",
    "- VP -> VBD PP: This rule shows that a verb phrase (VP) consists of a past tense verb (VBD) followed by a prepositional phrase (PP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- PP -> TO NP: This rule represents a prepositional phrase (PP) consisting of the preposition \"to\" (TO) followed by a noun phrase (NP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- NP -> PNP: This rule indicates that a noun phrase (NP) can be a proper noun phrase (PNP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- CC -> and: This rule simply represents the coordinating conjunction \"and\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- VP -> VBD PP: This rule indicates that a verb phrase (VP) can be a past tense verb (VBD) followed by a prepositional phrase (PP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- PP -> Prep NP: This rule represents a prepositional phrase (PP) consisting of a preposition (Prep) followed by a noun phrase (NP).\n",

    "- NP -> POS Noun: This rule indicates that a noun phrase (NP) can be a possessive pronoun (POS) followed by a noun (Noun).\n",

    "       - Preposition: \"to\" introduces the prepositional phrase and indicates the direction or goal of the action.\n",
    "       - NP: \"England\" is the object of the preposition, representing the specific destination.\n",
    "   - VP: \"is not hard\" is another verb phrase that provides additional information about the action.\n",
